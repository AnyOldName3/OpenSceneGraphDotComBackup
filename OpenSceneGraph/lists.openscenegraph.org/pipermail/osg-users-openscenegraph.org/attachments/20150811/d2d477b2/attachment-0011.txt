CMake Error at /usr/lib64/boost/Boost.cmake:536 (message):
  The imported target "boost_date_time-static" references the file

     "/usr/lib64/lib64/libboost_date_time.a"

  but this file does not exist.  Possible reasons include:

  * The file was deleted, renamed, or moved to another location.

  * An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully.

  * The installation package was faulty and contained

     "/usr/lib64/boost/Boost.cmake"

  but not all the files it references.
