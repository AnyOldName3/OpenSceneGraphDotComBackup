The build system is configured to instal libraries to /usr/local/lib64
Your applications may not be able to find your installed libraries unless you:
    set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (user specific) or
    update your ld.so configuration (system wide)
You have an ld.so.conf.d directory on your system, so if you wish to ensure that
applications find the installed osg libraries, system wide, you could install a
openscenegraph specific ld.so configuration with:
    sudo make install_ld_conf
